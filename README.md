# bpy-hex-to-srgb
Do you work with hex colors in Blender? <br />
Have you ever exported a model from Blender and then imported it back into Unity only to find out that your material colors are all fucked up?  <br />
Look no further, with the plugin you just need to: <br />
- Input the hex in the new menu under materials
- Get the sRGB values which you then 
- input in the material.

If you need to see the actual result, turn off srgb in color management.
