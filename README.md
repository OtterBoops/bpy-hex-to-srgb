# bpy-hex-to-srgb
Do you work with hex colors in Blender?
Have you ever exported a model from Blender and then imported it back into Unity only to find out that your material colors are all fucked up?
Look no further, with the plugin you just need to input the hex in the new menu under materials and you get the sRGB values which you then input in the material.
If you need to see the actual result, turn off srgb in color management.
